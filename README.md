Author: Kamesh K
Date: 29-09-2025

Overview

Kratox-K is a Python-based backdoor project designed for educational and cybersecurity research purposes. It demonstrates remote administration capabilities in a controlled environment.

⚠️ Warning: Use only on machines you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal.

Features

Remote command execution

File upload/download

Screenshot capture (PIL.ImageGrab)

Optional webcam capture (OpenCV)

Multi-client support

Requirements

Python 3.8+

pillow (for screenshots)

opencv-python (optional, for camera)

pip install pillow opencv-python

Usage
Server
python server.py


Set SERVER_IP and PORT before running.

Accepts incoming client connections.

Client
python client.py


Connects automatically to the server.

Ensure testing is done in a controlled lab environment.

Security Notes

Only test on authorized systems.

Notify users when running tests.

Adjust firewall/network settings as needed.

License

Educational and research use only. Unauthorized deployment in production or third-party systems is prohibited.

If you want, I can also add a visual badge section and table of contents to make it look more professional for GitHub. This gives it that “real open-source project” feel.

Do you want me to do that too?

## Overview

**Kratox-K** is a Python-based backdoor project intended **only** for educational purposes, security research, and authorized penetration testing in controlled lab environments. It demonstrates remote administration, file transfer, and optional media capture capabilities.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Do **not** use on systems you do not own or do not have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal and may result in criminal charges.

## Features

- Remote command execution  
- File upload / download  
- Screenshot capture (`PIL.ImageGrab`)  
- Optional webcam capture (`OpenCV`)  
- Multi-client handling (basic threaded server)

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- `pillow` (for screenshots)  
- `opencv-python` (optional, for webcam)  

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install pillow opencv-python


Example requirements.txt:

pillow
opencv-python ; optional

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/kratox-k.git
cd kratox-k


Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # linux/mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration

Edit the configuration variables at the top of server.py and client.py:

# server.py
SERVER_IP = "0.0.0.0"
PORT = 54321

# client.py
SERVER_IP = "192.168.1.100"   # set to your server's reachable IP
PORT = 54321


Use private lab networks or loopback (127.0.0.1) for local testing.

Usage
Server

Start the server on a machine you control:

python server.py


The server listens for client connections and provides an interactive prompt or command interface for connected clients.

Client

Run the client on the target/test machine (only with permission):

python client.py


The client connects to the configured server and accepts remote commands.

Examples

Execute a remote command (from server):

> exec whoami
target-machine\user


Download a file (server -> client):

> download /path/to/remote/file.txt ./local_copy.txt


Capture a screenshot (client side needs Pillow):

> screenshot save_as remote_screenshot.png

If you want, I can:
- produce a shorter README (one-page), or  
- generate a `README.md` and `requirements.txt` file and provide download links, or  
- create a README without badges and with an automatically generated license header.
